                    <h3>A RESTORATION ECOLOGY PROJECT</h3>
                    <p>We are 14 students in a Research in Restoration Ecology course taught by
                        Dr. Cara Roberts at the Governor’s School for Science and Mathematics (GSSM). This is the first
                        iteration of this course, and we are undertaking a research project that is planned to span across
                        multiple years. We are excited to help restore this little plot of land!</p>

                    <h1>Our Focus</h1>
                    <p>Restoration ecology entails renewing and restoring ecosystems that were damaged or degraded by human activity.
                            Our focus is to increase the abundance of rare natives in our site, as many of them have been
                            outcompeted by other species growing there. In other words, invasive and aggressive native species
                            within the plot are using up resources that rare native species need, meaning they cannot grow and thrive there.
                            Our current thought process is that, to increase native biodiversity, we will have to remove some of these species from our plot.</p>

                        <h1>Goals</h1>
                            <p><strong>Overarching Objective: </strong>To restore and revitalize a targeted area in
                            Kalmia Gardens by identifying both the native species present and the invasive and/or
                            aggressive species that threaten biodiversity, and then subsequently applying research
                            methods in restoration ecology to our plot of land, Deen’s Garden.</p>
                            <p><strong>Near-Future Goal: </strong>To conduct fieldwork in quantitative analysis to
                            serve as accurate baseline data that will perform three functions: <strong>1)</strong> to suggest
                            quantitatively which species threaten which plots, <strong>2)</strong> to identify and quantify which
                            native plants are present and which natives are thriving or struggling, and <strong>3)</strong>
                            to serve as a referential foundation for future research in Deen’s Garden.</p>
                            <p><strong>Deen Five-Year Plan: </strong>Deen Five-Year Plan: To increase measurable
                            biodiversity within the Deen Plot through the safe and deliberate removal of invasive
                            and/or aggressive flora, conducted through careful and persistent in-the-field observations
                            and monitoring of the Deen Garden by GSSM students.</p>
