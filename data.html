                        <h1>Timeline</h1>
                        <p>This is the first year of the GSSM research class restoration ecology.
                            Our goal for this semester is to collect the baseline data and develop a
                            plan for how to restore our plot (Deen Plot) in Kalmia Gardens for both this
                            semester and for classes in the future. Our restoration project is going to be continued each year
                            by a new group of students enrolled in the class. We hope to monitor our plot
                            over the course of 5+ years to see how our work influences the native
                            biodiversity of this region and whether it allows native plant species to thrive.</p>

                            <h1>Data</h1>
                            <p>Our team is collecting data about our plot’s species diversity and tracking how it
                                will change throughout our restoration project. Currently we have divided the plot into
                                several triangular sub-plots and have been gathering data (such as how many different plant species
                                there are and how abundant they are) from them. The reason for our irregular plot shapes is due
                                to the various obstacles like trees, large shrubs, and branches. The size and general shape of
                                our triangular plot were determined by the position of trees to anchor our tape/rope and the amount
                                of foliage in the way when mapping the plot. The various sub-plots are divided into three groups:
                                A, B, and C. A sub-plot’s group only indicates what group of student’s created them; though they
                                can signify where the plots are as B-plots generally populate the northern region of our plot,
                                A-plots the middle, and C-plots the edge or southern most region. We have collected information on
                                what species, and how many, occupy these various sub-plots and will continue to monitor and update
                                them. Our data will prove invaluable in shaping our restoration goals and tracking our progress.</p>
